--1) Find	the	total	sales	by	territory	for	all	rows	in	the	Sales.SalesOrderHeader	table.		
--Return	only	those	territories	that	have	exceeded	$10	million	in	historical	sales.		
--Return	the	total	sales	and	the	TerritoryID	column.
--2) Using	the	query	from	the	previous	question,	join	to	the	Sales.SalesTerritory	table	
--and	replace	the	TerritoryID	column	with	the	territory’s	name.
--3) Using	the	Production.Product	table,	find	how	many	products	are	associated	with	
--each	color.		Ignore	all	rows	where	the	color	has	a	NULL	value.		Once	grouped,	return	
--to	the	results	only	those	colors	that	had	at	least	20	products	with	that color.
--4) Starting	with	the	Sales.SalesOrderHeader	table,	join	to	the	Sales.SalesOrderDetail	
--table.		This	table	contains	the	line	item	details	associated	with	each	sale.		From	
--Sales.SalesOrderDetail,	join	to	the	Production.Product	table.		Return	the	Name	
--column	from	Production.Product	and	assign	it	the	column	alias	“Product	Name”.		
--For	each	product,	find	out	how	many	of	each	product	was	ordered	for	all	orders	that	
--occurred	in	2006.		Only	output	those	products	where	at	least	200	were	ordered.
--5) Find	the	first	and	last	name	of	each	customer	who	has	placed	at	least	6	orders	
--between	July	1,	2005	and	December	31,	2006.		Order	your	results	by	the	number	of	
--orders	placed	in	descending	order.		(Hint:	You	will	need	to	join	to	three	tables	–
--Sales.SalesOrderHeader,	Sales.Customer,	and	Person.Person.		You	will	use	every	
--clause	to	complete	this	query).
